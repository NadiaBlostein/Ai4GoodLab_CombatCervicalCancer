# BACKGROUND

Heritability is defined is as the proportion of variance of a quantitative phenotype that is attributable to additive genetic – as opposed to environmental – effects. For neuroanatomical traits, one would intuitively assume an inverse relationship between heritability and brain plasticity. Based on this idea, I would like to build upon a previous undergraduate research project that I completed at the Computational Brain Anatomy Laboratory under Dr. Mallar Chakravarty's supervision. In this study, I examined the heritability of the volume and shape (vertex-wise surface area, vertex-wise displacement) of the striatum, thalamus and globus pallidus. I would be curious to see if there is a spatial relationship between the heritability of vertex-wise measures and the evolutionary expansion of the subcortical structures under examination.


# DATA

	► Vertex-wise heritability estimates of subcortical structures from my previous project (used the Human Connectome Project T1w structural MRIs)✺
	► Primate brain templates and subcortical labels

# TOOLS

	► Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) to register brains to each other *using subcortical labels as brain masks)
	► Spatial permutation test (Alexander-Bloch et al. 2018)

# DELIVERABLES

	► brain map of vertex-wise evolutionary expansion across the six subcortical structures under study
	► examination of the relationship between this brain map and vertex-wise heritability measures
